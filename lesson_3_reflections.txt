When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	To allow collaboration between multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Incase a change is not ready for public consumption

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: Clone a repository on GitHub only, existing repo to new repo. Clones: copys a repository to your local machine, either from GitHub or a local repo. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It allows you to work with that code offline.
